# Zippy
### File Zipper and Unzipper in JAVA
> Zippy is a Java application that simplifies file compression and decompression. It supports various file types and offers an intuitive interface for zipping and unzipping files. Zippy also includes password-based encryption for added security. I have implemented this functionality using the zip4j library. In essence, Zippy is a versatile tool for efficient file management and secure data handling.
